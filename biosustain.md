# DTU biosustain

DTU biosustain works on several aspects of making the world more sustainable. Either 
by creating biofactories for products create normally by the petrochemical industry,
to replace animal derived food products by microbial produced ones, or by creating 
products in cells which are only hard to get from plants.
